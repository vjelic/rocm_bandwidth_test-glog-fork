**AMD Work Bench** is the next generation of the ROCm Bandwidth Test, designed to measure the bandwidth between CPU and GPU devices on AMD platforms. This version has been completely rewritten with a focus on modularity and extensibility through a plugin-based architecture.

>[!NOTE]
>This project is a successor to [RBT](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocm_bandwidth_test/en/latest/index.html)
>and [TB](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/TransferBench/en/latest/index.html).

## Overview

AMD Work Bench leverages [TransferBench (TB)](https://github.com/ROCm/TransferBench) as its core engine for benchmarking data transfers. This approach allows for more flexible and efficient testing scenarios.

- **Plugin Architecture:** Easily extend the functionality of AMD Work Bench with custom plugins.
- **Modular Design:** Separate concerns for better maintenance and development.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Improved algorithms and integration with TransferBench for precise measurements.

See the [full library and API documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/index.html)


## Features

- **CPU to GPU Bandwidth Testing:** Measure data transfer rates in various scenarios.
- **GPU to GPU Bandwidth Testing:** For systems with multiple GPUs.
- **Multi-Threaded Testing:** Simulate real-world applications with concurrent data transfers.
- **Extensibility:** Add new test scenarios through plugins.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- ROCm compatible hardware
- ROCm stack installed ([Installation Guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/index.html))
- GCC compiler

### Build from Source

See [Build from Source](#Build_from_Source)

```bash
git clone https://github.amd.com/LSTT/amd-work-bench.git
cd amd-work-bench
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release
make
```

## Usage

AMD Work Bench can be run with various options to customize the test:
```bash
./amd_work_bench [-h|--help] [-v|--version] 
./amd_work_bench plugin [--help] 
```

- --help: Displays help information.
- --version: Shows the application version.
- --plugin: Loads a specific plugin for extended functionality.

### Example

```bash
./amd_work_bench --plugin -r my_custom_plugin

``` 

## Plugins

Plugins are the heart of AMD Work Bench's extensibility. Here's how you can create or use them:

- Creating Plugins: Follow the `Plugin Development Guide`.
- Using Existing Plugins: Check the `plugins` directory for available options.
